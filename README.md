- 👋 Hi, I’m @TimboCalifornia
- 👀 I’m interested in data/business analytics in the pursuit of public policy based on data and evidence, not precedence.  
- 🌱 I’m transitioning from Excel and STATA towards SQL, R, Python, and Tableau. 
- 💞️ I’d like to collaborate on public policy data research, especially economic, public health, and/or political data. 
- 📫 Message me on Git if you want!
