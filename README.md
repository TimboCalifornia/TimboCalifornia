- 👋 Hi, I’m @TimboCalifornia!  Check my website www.TimothyIrvine.com for links to all my socials. 
- 👀 I’m interested in data/business analytics in the pursuit of public policy based on data and evidence, not precedence.  
- 🌱 I’m upskilling from Excel, SQL, and STATA towards R, Python, and Tableau. 
- 💞️ I’d like to collaborate on public policy data research, especially economic, public health, and/or political data. 
- 📫 Message me on Kaggle or LinkedIn if you want to collaborate!

Complete .ZIP dataset archives will be hosted on Kaggle. 
My files hosted here include just the .RMD and/or knitted .HTML outputs from R of the following work, structured as....  
- "alpha" v001 learning work, mostly from the Google Coursera training 
- "beta" v01 projects, mostly practicing my skills doing analysis on issues that are important to me 
- "real" v1.0 projects, where I collaborate with others to build out my portfolio
