- 👋 Hi, I’m @TimboCalifornia
- 👀 I’m interested in data/business analytics in the pursuit of public policy based on data and evidence, not precedence.  
- 🌱 I’m upskilling from Excel, SQL, and STATA towards R, Python, and Tableau. 
- 💞️ I’d like to collaborate on public policy data research, especially economic, public health, and/or political data. 
- 📫 Message me on Kaggle or LinkedIn if you want to collaborate!

I generally focus on Kaggle more (than GitHub) and complete .ZIP dataset archives will be hosted on Kaggle. 
My files hosted here include the .RMD and their knitted .HTML outputs of the following, structured as below.  
- "alpha" v001 learning work, mostly from the Google Coursera training 
- "beta" v01 projects, mostly practicing my skills doing analysis on issues that are important to me 
- "real" v1.0 projects, where I collaborate with others to build out my portfolio
